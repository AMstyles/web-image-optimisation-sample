      Notice how much faster these WebP images load compared to the original
      JPEG or PNG formats.

    <ul>
      <li>
        These images are cached for <time>1 minute</time>, so subsequent page
        loads will be even faster.

        For a deeper look into performance improvements, use Chrome's Lighthouse
        tool to audit the page's performance, particularly the impact of
        optimized images.
